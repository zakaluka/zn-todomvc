Test mildrenben/surface in app inspired by TodoMVC

This project is a test of how it is to do a TodoMVC-type app using Surface, a material design CSS-only framework.  You can learn more about Surface [here](https://github.com/mildrenben/surface).

Please note that I did not add all the features from TodoMVC, it looks absolutely nothing like other TodoMVC projects, and, at this time, I do not intend to add any more features here.
